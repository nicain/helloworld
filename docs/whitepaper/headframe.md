## Headframe and Cross-Platform Registration

To enable data acquisition by intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) and two-photon calcium imaging, each animal was implanted with a stereotaxically-aligned headframe that provides a cranial window for brain imaging and permits head fixation in a reproducible configuration for repeat imaging of the same brain areas or cells.An integrated suite of tools (imaging instruments, mouse behavior platforms and implant alignment hardware) was developed to enable the identical presentation of stimuli acrossdifferent instruments,and to registerdata acquired from different instruments. All measurements are referenced to a plane passing through lambda and bregma and the mediolateral  axis  (origin  at  lambda).Initial  measurements  showed  that  the  cranial  window  angle  was  at  23 degrees of roll,and 6 degrees of pitch.To achieve standardization, a head-frame implant (Fig. 2) was designed to provide registration relative to lambda and to enable head-fixation  at  a controlled angle.Use of a custom fixture enabled placement of the head-frame such that the craniotomy could be repeatability centered at x = -2.8mm and y = 1.3mm on the reference plane.
