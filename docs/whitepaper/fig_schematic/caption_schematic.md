**Figure: 1** Schematic of the Allen Brain Observatory data acquisition workflow. Mice expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors in  subsets  of  cortical  neurons received implantation  ofa  custom  headframe. Intrinsic  signal  imaging wasused  to map functional  visual areas and retinotopy. Mice werehabituated tothe passive sensing task. In vivotwo-photon calcium imaging wascollected across multiple sessions duringa  diverse  set  of  stimuli.  Eye  tracking,  body  position  and  running  data wascollected. A  surgery  monitoring  step was performed prior to brain specimen preparation, and anatomical fiducials were aligned by whole-brain serial imaging.
